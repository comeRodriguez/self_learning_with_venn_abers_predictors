# Self Learning Using Venn Abers Predictors

This repository contains a first and naive implementation of a self learning approach using Venn Abers predictors.  \
There are 3 differents folders into it:
 - data: contains some datasets used for testing the approach
 - notebooks: contains some other folders with notebooks where some experiments were done
 - python_code: naive implementation of self learning approaches, with implementation of a simple neural network with one hidden layer, Inductive Venn Abers Predictors, and usefull functions used in the repository.

Please note that the self learning using Venn Abers predictors approach here can be used only with the class implemented in the repository. The code wasn't done to be use with any type of algorithm.  \
You can take the code and modify it for your own purpose.  \
